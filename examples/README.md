# Examples

## How to run examples

The examples are configured to run from the source code, instead of downloading a package from package manager. This means that you must build the driver (see [Contributing](../CONTRIBUTING.md#local-installation-and-build-process)).

Before running examples, you need to build the driver (see: [CONTRIBUTING.MD](../CONTRIBUTING.md#local-installation-and-build-process))
and install packages for the examples by running in this directory:

```bash
npm install
```

You also need Cassandra or ScyllaDB running with at least three nodes
(the examples use a replication factor 3 which can be satisfied by a database containing at least that number of nodes).
By default, examples assume the entrypoint for the database is ``172.17.0.2:9042`` but you can change it by setting ``SCYLLA_URI`` env variable.

You can run all examples with the following command:

```bash
npm run examples
```

This will check if all examples finished successfully, but will hide any output generated by the examples.

Alternatively you can run just a specific example by providing the path to it:

```bash
node ./basic/basic-connect.js
```

## Paging examples

Those examples show how queries can be paged. This included the following code samples:

1. ``each-row.js`` - Show usage of ``client.eachRow()``, without auto paging.
1. ``each-row-auto paged.js`` - Show usage of ``client.eachRow()``, with auto paging.

## Other examples

For examples from the DataStax driver, see ``./DataStax`` directory.
